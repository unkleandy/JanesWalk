# Contributions

Welcome to our project. We cannot wait for your contributions!

## How to Contribute

An Open Source project can be a lot of work! As an individual who is persuing this as a heart/side project, the time I can allocate to the coding management and communications of this project is limited. This is where I need a community to help build, maintain and animate the process. All levels of implication are welcome!

### Contributing as a Maintainer

If you are curious to what it takes to maintain an Open Source project or animate and moderate the community that will build it, please send an email to [janeswalkapp@gmail.com](mailto:janeswalkapp@gmail.com) with the subject line *Maintainer*.
